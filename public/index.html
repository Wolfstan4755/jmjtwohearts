    <h1>The story of the scapular</h1>
    <div>
        On July 16, 1251, the Carmelite order was suffering a period of oppression and hardship. The order of hermits had recently fled their Mt. Carmel home in the face of violence from the Saracens, and now they floated about Europe, struggling to adapt to their new surroundings amidst local hostility and skepticism.
        Their way of life was changing, and the future was uncertain. In the face of these trials, the prior general Simon Stock (now St. Simon Stock) appealed to Our Lady, the perfect model of their way of life, for help and assurance. In response, Our Lady of Mount Carmel appeared to him with a gift: the brown scapular. She offered this garment as a sign of divine protection for the Carmelite order and promised special privileges for those who wear it faithfully.
        The Church extends this Carmelite devotion to all the laity who are “vested” in the brown scapular, enrolled in the Brown Scapular Confraternity, live according to the Marian devotion, and wear the sacramental continuously.
    </div>
    <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
    <h1>The Promises of the Brown Scapular</h1>
    <div>
    Many scapulars are embroidered with the original promise of the Holy Virgin to St. Simon Stock: “Whosoever dies clothed with this scapular shall not suffer eternal fire.” While this is the most well-known promise associated with the brown scapular, it is not the only benefit of the devotion! Here are all the privileges connected to the scapular devotion.
    As a sacramental, the brown scapular confers extra grace and disposes us to cooperate with it. (CCC 1670)
    The Blessed Virgin Mary promises special protection in life and death
    Final perseverance “at the hour of death”
    Assistance after death and an early release from Purgatory (also called the Sabbatine Privilege)
    </div>
    <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
    <h1>Our Lady assigned certain conditions to her promises regarding the brown scapular devotion.</h1>
    <div>
    Wear the brown scapular continuously.
    Live a life of charity.
    Observe chastity according to your state in life.

        <li>Abstain from meat on Wednesdays and Saturdays (an exception is made for Christmas) in addition to the fest days prescribed by the Church.</li>
        <li>With the permission of a priest, say five decades of the Most Holy Rosary.</li>
