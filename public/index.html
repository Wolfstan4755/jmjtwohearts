    <h2>The 15 promises of the Rosary </h2>
    <p>1. To all those who shall recite my rosary devoutly, I promise my special protection and very great graces.</p>
    <p>2. Those who shall persevere in the recitation of my rosary shall receive signal graces.</p>
    <p>3. The rosary shall be a very powerful armor against hell; it will destroy vice, deliver from sin, and dispel heresy.</p>
    <p>4. The rosary will make virtue and good works flourish, and will obtain for souls the most abundant divine mercies; it will draw the hearts of men from the love of the world to the love </p>
    <p>of God, and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. How many souls shall sanctify themselves by this means!</p>
    <p>5. Those who trust themselves to me through the rosary shall not perish.</p>

    <p> become worthy of eternal life.</p>
    <p>7. Those truly devoted to my rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.</p>
    <p>8. Those who faithfully recite my rosary shall find during their life and at the hour of their death the light of God,</p> 
    <p>the fullness of his graces, and shall share in the merits of the blessed.</p>
    <p>9. I shall deliver very promptly from purgatory the souls devoted to my rosary.</p>
    <p>10. The true children of my rosary shall enjoy great glory in heaven.</p>
    <p>11. What you ask through my rosary, you shall obtain.</p>
    <p>12. Those who propagate my rosary will be aided by me in all their necessities.</p>

    <p>in life and in death, the entire celestial court.</p>
    <p>14. Those who recite my rosary faithfully are all my beloved children, the brothers and sisters of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>15. Devotion to my rosary is a great sign of predestination.</p>

    <h4>The story of the scapular</h4>
    <p>On July 16, 1251, the Carmelite order was suffering a period of oppression and hardship. The order of hermits had recently fled their Mt. Carmel home in the face of violence from</p>
    <p>the Saracens, and now they floated about Europe, struggling to adapt to their new surroundings amidst local hostility and skepticism.</p>
    <p>Their way of life was changing, and the future was uncertain. In the face of these trials, the prior general Simon Stock (now St. Simon Stock) appealed to Our Lady, the perfect model </p>
    <p>of their way of life, for help and assurance. In response, Our Lady of Mount Carmel appeared to him with a gift: the brown scapular. She offered this garment as a sign of divine protection </p>
    <p>for the Carmelite order and promised special privileges for those who wear it faithfully.</p>
    <p>The Church extends this Carmelite devotion to all the laity who are “vested” in the brown scapular, enrolled in the Brown Scapular Confraternity, live according to the Marian devotion,</p>
    <p> and wear the sacramental continuously.</p>
    <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
    <h4>The Promises of the Brown Scapular</h4>
    <p>Many scapulars are embroidered with the original promise of the Holy Virgin to St. Simon Stock: “Whosoever dies clothed with this scapular shall not suffer eternal fire.” While this is</p>
    <p>the most well-known promise associated with the brown scapular, it is not the only benefit of the devotion! Here are all the privileges connected to the scapular devotion.</p>
    <p>As a sacramental, the brown scapular confers extra grace and disposes us to cooperate with it. (CCC 1670)</p>
    <p>Final perseverance “at the hour of death”</p>
    <p>Assistance after death and an early release from Purgatory (also called the Sabbatine Privilege)</p>
    <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
    <h5>Our Lady assigned certain conditions to her promises regarding the brown scapular devotion.</h5>
    <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
    <p>1. Wear the brown scapular continuously.</p>
    <p>2.Live a life of charity.</p>
    <p>3.Observe chastity according to your state in life.</p>
    <p>One of the following:</p>
    <p> * Recite daily the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary or the Divine Office</p>
    <p>* Abstain from meat on Wednesdays and Saturdays (an exception is made for Christmas) in addition to the fest days prescribed by the Church.</p>
    <p>* With the permission of a priest, say five decades of the Most Holy Rosary.</P>
    <p>* With the permission of a priest, substitute some other good work</p>
