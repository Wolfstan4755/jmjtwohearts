    <h4>The story of the scapular</h4>
    <p>On July 16, 1251, the Carmelite order was suffering a period of oppression and hardship. The order of </p>
    <p>hermits had recently fled their Mt. Carmel home in the face of violence from the Saracens, and now they</p>
    <p>floated about Europe, struggling to adapt to their new surroundings amidst local hostility and skepticism.</p>
    <p>Their way of life was changing, and the future was uncertain. In the face of these trials, the prior </p>
    <p>general Simon Stock (now St. Simon Stock) appealed to Our Lady, the perfect model of their way of life, for</p>
    <p> help and assurance. In response, Our Lady of Mount Carmel appeared to him with a gift: the brown scapular. </p>
    <p>She offered this garment as a sign of divine protection for the Carmelite order and promised special privileges</p>
    <p>for those who wear it faithfully. The Church extends this Carmelite devotion to all the laity who are “vested” </p>
    <p>in the brown scapular, enrolled in the Brown Scapular Confraternity, live according to the Marian devotion,</p>
    <p>and wear the sacramental continuously.</p>
    <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
    <h4>The Promises of the Brown Scapular</h4>
    <p>Many scapulars are embroidered with the original promise of the Holy Virgin to St. Simon Stock: “Whosoever</p>
    <p>dies clothed with this scapular shall not suffer eternal fire.” While this is the most well-known promise</p>
    <p>associated with the brown scapular, it is not the only benefit of the devotion! Here are all the privileges</p>
    <p>connected to the scapular devotion. As a sacramental, the brown scapular confers extra grace and disposes us</p>
    <p> to cooperate with it. (CCC 1670) Final perseverance “at the hour of death”Assistance after death and an early</p>
    <p>release from Purgatory (also called the Sabbatine Privilege)</p>
    <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
    <h5>Our Lady assigned certain conditions to her promises regarding the brown scapular devotion.</h5>
    <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
    <p>1. Wear the brown scapular continuously.</p>
    <p>2.Live a life of charity.</p>
    <p>3.Observe chastity according to your state in life.</p>
    <p>One of the following:</p>
    <p> * Recite daily the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary or the Divine Office</p>
    <p>* Abstain from meat on Wednesdays and Saturdays (an exception is made for Christmas) in addition to the fest days prescribed by the Church.</p>
    <p>* With the permission of a priest, say five decades of the Most Holy Rosary.</P>
    <p>* With the permission of a priest, substitute some other good work</p>
