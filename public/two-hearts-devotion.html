            <h2>What is the Two Hearts Devotion?</h2>
            <p>The Two Hearts Devotion is a powerful and beloved practice in the Catholic Church, focusing on the deep and unbreakable connection between the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. This devotion encourages the faithful to reflect on the love, compassion, and mercy represented by the hearts of Jesus and Mary, and to offer prayers and sacrifices in reparation for sins and for the conversion of sinners.</p>

            <p>The Sacred Heart of Jesus is a representation of Christâ€™s love for humanity, symbolized by His heart, often depicted as surrounded by thorns, pierced, and burning with love. Devotion to the Sacred Heart began in the 17th century after the visions of St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, who was given the mission to spread this devotion to the world. It reminds the faithful of Christ's infinite love, mercy, and willingness to forgive.</p>

            <img class="center-image"src="/images/immaculate-heart-mary.jpg" alt="Immaculate Heart of Mary" width="300" height="200">
            <p>The Immaculate Heart of Mary symbolizes her pure, sinless heart, which was completely dedicated to the will of God. This devotion grew in prominence especially after the apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima, where Mary requested the consecration of the world to her Immaculate Heart. Devotion to her heart calls for consecration, prayer, and a life of purity and love, echoing Mary's perfect obedience to Gods plan.</p>
