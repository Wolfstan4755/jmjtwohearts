        <h1>The Story of the Scapular</h1>

        <h1>The Promises of the Brown Scapular</h1>
        <div class="confined-text">
            <p>Many scapulars are embroidered with the original promise of the Holy Virgin to St. Simon Stock: “Whosoever dies clothed with this scapular shall not suffer eternal fire.” While this is the most well-known promise associated with the brown scapular, it is not the only benefit of the devotion!</p>
            <p>As a sacramental, the brown scapular confers extra grace...</p>
        </div>
        <h1>Conditions for the Brown Scapular Devotion</h1>
        <div class="confined-text">
