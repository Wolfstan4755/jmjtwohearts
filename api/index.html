    <h2>The 15 promises of the Rosary</h2>
    <p>1.To all those who shall recite my rosary devoutly, I promise my special protection and very great graces.</p>
    <p>2.Those who shall persevere in the recitation of my rosary shall receive signal graces.</p>
    <p>3. The rosary shall be a very powerful armor against hell; it will destroy vice, deliver from sin, and dispel heresy.</p>
    <p>4. The rosary will make virtue and good works flourish, and will obtain for souls the most abundant divine mercies; it will draw the hearts of men from the love of the world to the love
         of God, and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. How many souls shall sanctify themselves by this means!</p>
    <p>5. Those who trust themselves to me through the rosary shall not perish.</p>
    <p>6. Those who shall recite my rosary devoutly, meditating on its mysteries, shall not be overwhelmed by misfortune. The sinner shall be converted; the just shall grow in grace and
         become worthy of eternal life</p>
