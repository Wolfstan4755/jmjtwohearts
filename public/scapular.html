                <p>Many scapulars are embroidered with the original promise of the Holy Virgin to St. Simon Stock: “Whosoever dies clothed with this scapular shall not suffer eternal fire.” While this </p>
                <p>is the most well-known promise associated with the brown scapular, it is not the only benefit of the devotion! Here are all the privileges connected to the scapular devotion.</p>
                <p>As a sacramental, the brown scapular confers extra grace and disposes us to cooperate with it. (CCC 1670)</p>
                <p>The Blessed Virgin Mary promises special protection in life and death</p>
                <p>Final perseverance “at the hour of death”</p>
                <P>Assistance after death and an early release from Purgatory (also called the Sabbatine Privilege)</p>

            <div class="confined-text">
                Wear the brown scapular continuously.
                Live a life of charity.
                Observe chastity according to your state in life.
                 One of the following:
                Recite daily the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary or the Divine Office
                Abstain from meat on Wednesdays and Saturdays (an exception is made for Christmas) in addition to the fest days prescribed by the Church.
                With the permission of a priest, say five decades of the Most Holy Rosary.
                With the permission of a priest, substitute some other good work
